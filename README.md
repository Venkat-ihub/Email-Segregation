# HR Email Parsing and Applicant Classification System

## üìÑ Project Overview  
The HR Email Parsing and Applicant Classification System automates the recruitment process by parsing job application emails, extracting key applicant details (such as name, email, job role, and resume link), and storing this data in MongoDB. The system also includes a Django-based web interface for viewing and filtering applicants by job categories. Resumes are securely uploaded to Google Drive, generating shareable links.
